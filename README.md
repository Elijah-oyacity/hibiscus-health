Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:mN#BNxkwmyCfG6D@db.noxaiikfplwznbmibfxv.supabase.co:5432/postgres"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://postgres.noxaiikfplwznbmibfxv:mN#BNxkwmyCfG6D@aws-0-eu-west-2.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres"

# Auth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-nextauth-secret"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Google OAuth (Required)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"

# Stripe
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="your-stripe-secret-key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="your-stripe-publishable-key"
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="your-stripe-webhook-secret"

# App
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

### Google OAuth Setup

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google+ API
4. Go to "Credentials" and create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID
5. Add your domain to the authorized origins
6. Add `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` to the authorized redirect URIs
7. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret to your `.env` file

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hibiscus-health.git
   cd hibiscus-health
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate reset --force
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.



   i have new superbase
which do you need, you can update the env

postgresql://postgres:mN#BNxkwmyCfG6D@db.noxaiikfplwznbmibfxv.supabase.co:5432/postgres

postgresql://postgres.noxaiikfplwznbmibfxv:mN#BNxkwmyCfG6D@aws-0-eu-west-2.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres

postgresql://postgres.noxaiikfplwznbmibfxv:mN#BNxkwmyCfG6D@aws-0-eu-west-2.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres

The error `Can't reach database server at db.noxaiikfplwznbmibfxv.supabase.co:5432` means your Supabase database is not reachable from your current environment. Here are the most common reasons and how to fix them:

---

### 1. **Supabase Project is Paused or Sleeping**
- Go to your [Supabase dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/).
- Make sure your project is **running** (not paused or sleeping). If it is, click "Resume project".

---

### 2. **Database Password or Connection String**
- Double-check your password and connection string in `.env`.
- You already escaped the `#` as `%23`, which is correct.

---

### 3. **Network/Firewall Issues**
- Some networks (corporate, school, VPN) block outgoing connections to non-standard ports like 5432.
- Try connecting from a different network or your phone's hotspot.

---

### 4. **Database is Still Provisioning**
- If you just created the Supabase project, it may take a few minutes for the database to be ready.

---

### 5. **Test Connection with psql**
If you have `psql` installed, try:
```sh
psql "postgresql://postgres:mN%23BNxkwmyCfG6D@db.noxaiikfplwznbmibfxv.supabase.co:5432/postgres"
```
If you get a connection error, the issue is with Supabase or your network.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Check your Supabase dashboard** for project status and database credentials.
2. **Try connecting with psql** (if available) to confirm it's not a Prisma-specific issue.
3. **Try from a different network** if possible.

If you confirm the project is running and the credentials are correct, but you still can't connect, let me know what you see in the Supabase dashboard (any warnings, errors, or status messages). I can help you troubleshoot further!

You are now using the Supabase pooler connection, which is the correct approach for Prisma on Supabase (since direct connections are often blocked or unavailable). Hereâ€™s what you should do next:

---

### 1. **Use `prisma db push` (not `migrate dev`)**
- The pooler does not support migrations with prepared statements, so you should use:
  ```sh
  npx prisma db push
  ```
- This will sync your schema to the database without using migrations.

---

### 2. **If you need seed data**
- You can add a `prisma/seed.ts` script and run:
  ```sh
  npx prisma db seed
  ```

---

### 3. **Start your app**
- Once `db push` completes, you can start your app as normal:
  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

---

### 4. **If you ever need to reset the schema**
- You can drop all tables from the Supabase SQL editor, then run `npx prisma db push` again.

---

**Summary:**  
- Use the pooler connection string for Prisma.
- Use `prisma db push` to sync your schema.
- Avoid `prisma migrate dev` or `migrate deploy` with the pooler.

If you see any errors or need to seed data, let me know!
